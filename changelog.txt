hyperlinkshow - Improvements and bug fixes
Use updated example for demonstration
 - new repeat command to allow video and audio tracks to repeat
 - fixed goto so that it forgets the path
 - improved debugging trace. Now enabled from pp_hyperlinkshow.py
 
Radiobuttonshow - bug fixes
 - removed code that merged links from the first track, all links should be in the show.

omxdriver.py - replace kill with SIGINT so so it has a chance to tidy up daemons and omxplayer.bin
Improvements to manual

Version 1.2.3c 4/1/2104
hopefully fixed unreliable video playing
additional checks in pp_omxdriver.py and pp_videoplayer.py for the incorrect termination of omxplayer
at the end of a track. One in a thousand times or so it does not send 'have a nice day' or terminate itself.
The code now detects these, ends the track, and kills omxplayer; some orphan dbus-daemons are left.
Occurences are reported to the terminal and in pp_log.log event though the -d option is not set.
